old replication feature: to provide high availability for stateless services.

why let replicas compete for a request?


Seems we can use a gateway to do health checking and load balancing?

# Python


python `__init__` file


The `__init__.py` file is a special file in Python that is used to mark a directory as a Python package. When a directory contains an `__init__.py` file, it indicates that the directory should be treated as a Python package, allowing you to organize your code into modules and sub-packages.


The `__init__.py` file can be empty or can contain Python code. It is executed when the package is imported and can be used to perform initialization tasks for the package, such as setting up variables, importing modules, or defining functions and classes that will be available when the package is used.
