old replication feature: to provide high availability for stateless services. 


# Questions


why let replicas compete for a request?


Seems we can use a gateway to do health checking and load balancing?

# Python


python `__init__` file


The `__init__.py` file is a special file in Python that is used to mark a directory as a Python package. When a directory contains an `__init__.py` file, it indicates that the directory should be treated as a Python package, allowing you to organize your code into modules and sub-packages.


The `__init__.py` file can be empty or can contain Python code. It is executed when the package is imported and can be used to perform initialization tasks for the package, such as setting up variables, importing modules, or defining functions and classes that will be available when the package is used.


python superclass vs. metaclass 


The superclass and metaclass are two different concepts in object-oriented programming:

1. Superclass: The superclass, also known as the base class or parent class, is an existing class from which a new class (subclass) is derived or extended. The subclass inherits the properties (attributes and methods) of the superclass and can override or extend them as needed. In other words, the superclass serves as a blueprint for the subclass. When a subclass extends a superclass, it inherits the superclass's characteristics and can add its own specific behavior.
2. Metaclass: A metaclass, also known as a class factory, is a class that defines the behavior of other classes (its instances). In Python, a metaclass is specified by assigning it to the `metaclass` parameter in a class definition. The metaclass controls the creation, initialization, and behavior of class objects. It defines how a class should be constructed, what attributes and methods it should have, and how its instances should behave. The metaclass is responsible for defining the behavior of the class, while the class itself defines the behavior of its instances.

To summarize, the superclass is an existing class that is extended or inherited by a subclass, while the metaclass is a class that defines the behavior of other classes (including the superclass). The superclass-subclass relationship defines the inheritance hierarchy, where the subclass extends the superclass, whereas the metaclass-class relationship defines how classes are created and behave.
